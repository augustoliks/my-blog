# fzf: Life is Too Short for Pipe Grep

This blog post outlines the advantages of the [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) (Fuzzy Finder CLI) and explains how to configure its [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) widgets.

## Searching in the Terminal - Tedious Task

Searching for items in the terminal is a trivial activity. Usually, we press arrow up/down to recall last commands executed, or check for matching expressions within a text file or command output using `$ command | grep`. This approach works well, but depending on the case, it is necessary execute `grep` multiple times until you find the elements that you need.

The most used Shells implemented a interactive search tool called by `CTRL` + `R` shortcut. In Zsh is implemented _reverse-i-search_ that works well, but you need to press the shortcut again to see next results. This behavior can be a problem if you need to recall commands executed multiple times with differents arguments.

This tedious task prompted me to research better alternatives for interactive searching.

## Fuzzy Finders - The Solution

After a few days of research, I found an amazing project that solves my problems: [fzf — command-line fuzzy finder](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf). It is a cross-platform Fuzzy Finder command-line written in Go. But, what is Fuzzy Finder?

Fuzzy Finder is a search tool category that to provide to users a quickly and flexibly way to find files, directories, or other elements, even when they don't remember the precise names. It employs fuzzy matching to find results based on partial words, erratic characters, or typographical errors. Imagine you have a large list of items (like files, text lines, command history) and you need to find something within them quickly.

[fzf — command-line fuzzy finder](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) filters the list of items as you type. This makes your searching much more efficient, avoiding `$ | grep` execution. It can receive output of the other commands for interative searching, for instance you can execute `$ kgp -A | fzf` to find pods in all Kubernetes cluster. In addition, it has some predefined shells widgets to search files, directories, and search history commands.

The next section will explain how to configure these widgets in Zsh.

## How to Configure fzf Widgets in Zsh

The first step is to install fzf. There are some distinct ways to install it described in [fzf — installation section](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#installation). Depending on the package manager on your workstation, the version available can be older. Thus, I will download and install the latest version available in GitHub Releases section.

```bash
# download the latest version (in a moment of the blog publish date, the latest version is 0.50.0)
$ wget https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/releases/latest/download/fzf-0.50.0-linux_amd64.tar.gz

# uncompress the donwloaded file to access the fzf binary
$ tar -xzvf fzf-0.50.0-linux_amd64.tar.gz

# check fzf binary execution
$ ./fzf --help

# move the binary to a folder present in your path
$ mv fzf ~/.local/bin/
```

You can get the widget setup source-code given the shell name as argument, for instance `--zsh`, `--fish`, and `--bash`. In this case, I will setup the widgets for Zsh.

```bash
# only available in 0.48.0 or later
$ source $(fzf --zsh)
```

Run the following command to check the keybindings are correctly loaded.

```bash
$ bindkey -a | grep fzf

"^R" fzf-history-widget  # CTRL + R: reverse history search
"^T" fzf-file-widget     # CTRL + T: search files
"^[c" fzf-cd-widget      # ALT  + C: search directories
```

You can customize the widgets fzf parameters through environment variables described in [fzf — environment variables](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf?tab=readme-ov-file#environment-variables--aliases). Each widget has its own environments variables you can customize based on your needs. The following code block demonstrates a parametrization exemple.

```bash
# CTRL + R: set vertical window for render the entire text of the command selected (useful in large command rendering).
export FZF_CTRL_R_OPTS="--height 100% --layout reverse --preview 'echo {}' --preview-window=wrap"

# ALT + C: set "fd-find" as directory search engine instead of "find" and exclude "venv|virtualenv" of the results during searching
export FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND="fd --type directory --exclude venv --exclude virtualenv"

# ALT + C: put the tree command output based on item selected ("{}" will be replaced by item selected in fzf execution runtime)
export FZF_ALT_C_OPTS="--preview 'tree -C {}'"

# CTRL + T: set "fd-find" as search engine instead of "find" and exclude .git for the results
export FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND="fd --exclude .git"

# CTRL + T: put the file content if item select is a file, or put tree command output if item selected is directory
export FZF_CTRL_T_OPTS="--preview '[ -d {} ] && tree -C {} || bat --color=always --style=numbers {}'"
```

The next section will present widgets executions preview.

## Results

- _fzf-history-widget_ executed by `CTRL` + `R`.

## Conclusion (Author Opinion)

My research for improvements in searching history commands has yielded results that exceed my expectations. fzf opened my mind to understand what is Fuzzy Finder and it purpose. It not limited to be command history searching only, it is a tool that you can search anything. It is really nice!

Certainly, I think it is a much better alternative to command history search widget default in Zsh, Bash, and Fish (_which already has a good history search widget_).

The interactive searching are blazingly fast and customization expanding the possibilities based on your needs. The productivity which fzf provides is really awesome! In a fact, that its justifies more than __59K stars__ in your GitHub repo.

I approve and recommend!
