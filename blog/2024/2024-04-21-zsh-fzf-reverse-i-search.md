# fzf â€” A Better Tool for History Commands Search

This blog post outlines the advantages of the Fuzzy Finder CLI [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) and explain how to use in [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) as an alternative to reverse-i-search widget.

## My journey from __reverse-i-search__ until __fzf-history-widget__

Remember executed commands can be a bored task, mainly in current days there are so many tools and differents stack technologies, each one with their your specific commands lines programs. For help in this, the shells like Zsh, Fish, and Bash implements a widget for interactive searching executed commands based on terms.

In Zsh is implemented _reverse-i-search_ widget by default, called by `CTRL` + `R`. The default implementation is good, but the commands are showed limited by one result, and you need to press `CTRL` + `R` again to see next results. This behavior can be a problem if you need to remember a commands using few terms in commands with multiple executions with differents arguments, letting you check the next results many times.

I searched by alternatives to better my experience over the _reverse-i-search_ widget. Then, I checked Fish implementation to get insights. The Fish show a interactive menu with commands executed matched by typed term. I liked the implementation, and I used it as my mainline to configure my Zsh.

After a few days of research, I found the amazing project [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), a command-line fuzzy finder written in Go. fzf is a command-line tool for interactive searching. Imagine you have a large list of items (like files, text lines, command history) and you need to find something within them quickly. fzf filters the list of items as you type. This makes your searching much more efficient, avoiding `$ | grep` execution. In addition, fzf has additional resources like integration with other commands and predefined shells widgets like search files, directories, and the __main interest point of this blog post, a widget dedicated to search history commands.__

> <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> There are widgets available for Fish, Bash, Zsh. You can check the implementations in the following directory in the GitHub project [github.com/junegunn/fzf/shell](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/tree/master/shell)

## How to Use

The first step, install fzf. There are some distinct ways to install described in the [fzf - installation section](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#installation). Depending of your System, the lastest version can be older. I will download the binary of the latest version available in GitHub Releases section.

```{code-block} bash
# download the latest version (in blog publish date, the latest version is 0.50.0)
$ wget https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/releases/latest/download/fzf-0.50.0-linux_amd64.tar.gz

# uncompress the donwloaded file to access the fzf binary
$ tar -xzvf fzf-0.50.0-linux_amd64.tar.gz

# check fzf binary execution
$ ./fzf --help

# move the binary to a folder present in your path
$ mv fzf ~/.local/bin/
```

The fzf has source code of the shell widgets embedded in a binary. You can show the source code given shell name as argument like `--zsh`, `--fish`, and `--bash`. In this case, we will load the widgets for Zsh.

```bash
$ source $(fzf --zsh)
```

Run the following command to check the keybindings loaded in the previous step.

```bash
$ bindkey -a | grep fzf

"^R" fzf-history-widget  # CTRL + R: reverse history search
"^T" fzf-file-widget     # CTRL + T: search files
"^[c" fzf-cd-widget      # ALT  + C: search directories
```

You can customize the fzf results prompt editing the `FZF_CTRL_R_OPTS` environment variable value. I configured a vertical window to show the full command wrapped (useful in large command rendering).

```bash
export fzf_CTRL_R_OPTS="--height 100% --layout reverse --preview 'echo {}' --preview-window=wrap"
```

## Results

The following picture is the result of the _fzf-history-widget_ executed by `CTRL` + `R`.

## Conclusion (Author Opinion)

My reasearch for improvements in search history commands brings to me a results that exceeds my needs. The fzf open my mind to a Fuzzy Finder tools purpose, extending the productivity not be limited by command history search, brings the possibilities to search anything, for example `$ kgp -A | fzf` to find a pods in Kubernetes cluster.

Certainly, I think that is much better alternative for the default search history widget of any Shell, even for the Fish shell, which already has a good history search widget.

The interactive searching are blazingly fast, even in large history file. For the last, the customization is good for expanding the possibilities based on your needs.

The productivity that fzf provides it is really awesome, justify the more than 59K stars in your GitHub repo.

I approve and recommend!
