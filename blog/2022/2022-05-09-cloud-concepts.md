# Cloud Basic Concepts

This section will be explained the Cloud Computing Definition, Advantages and Disadvantages, Cloud models, and Deployment models.

## Cloud Computing, Advantages and Disadvantages

One good definition of Cloud is the AWS Cloud definition: _Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing._

The definition may be confused for beginner Cloud students. To better understand the definition above, it is necessary to understand how association the following characteristics:

- Maintenance
> - Concern less about Energy, Hardware mount process
> - Business > TI technologies 

- Reliability
> - specialty in determining tools
> - high disponibilty possibility

- Security 
> - Specific Security Tools
> - Software and Hardware Security Solutions

- Performance
> - Hardware components as service 
> - If needs performance, exist possibilities

- Scalability:
> - Scalability on demand
> - Minimal IT Resources requirements to run applications

- Cost and Elasticity
> - Manage Costs
> - There is a Soft and Hard, but there are possibilities.

The natural workflows used by Development teams focus on the Agility of the contributions. Agility was not the main characteristic focused of the Operations/Infrastructure teams. The Stable characteristic was more important for Operations teams, a lot because of the Hardware interaction. With introduce and evolution of the technologies like Virtualization, the Infrastructure manual tasks become unnecessary and Infrastructure components started to be delivered as a service for Cloud Providers like AWS, Google, Microsoft, and others. 

Now, as well Development team, Agility became an accessible and interesting point to the Operations team's delivery results at the same speed as the development teams. The Maintenance of the infrastructure delivered as a service by Cloud Providers, bring the advantages like the unnecessary concern less like electric energy, hardware health status and etc, which it is important to focus a Business Purposes and not infrastructure requirements. When using Cloud Services, the Reliability rises as we outsource the labor of maintaining the components to a team focused on delivering a better solution in a specific way. Security is a component the reliability applies, it has a lot of services created in a specific way for help in infrastructures contexts and business cases. Hardware security should be cited because avoid concerns like natural disasters and other physical problems. 

One of the more important keywords of the Cloud is `possibilities`, the possibilities of the get high Computing Performance components when it needs and Scale components on demand and pay only time used are possibilities **which can** reduces costs if your application or infrastructure fits and is scalable infra, and you pay only necessary to application run, on-demand requests.

The Cloud Computing is not the definitive better solution for all IT infrastructure cases. The Cloud Computing is more one option to deploy your infrastructure or application. Before the adopted Cloud in your infrastructure, it is necessary answer the self question `"Why problem I need to resolve?"`. If your application fits in Cloud characteristics mentioned above, **maybe** it is the better choose for your problems.

## Main Cloud Models

The main Cloud Models are:

- __IaaS__ (_Infrastructure as a Service_): Infrastructure components delivered as a service, for example, Virtual Machines, Networks, Firewalls etc.
> Examples: AWS VPC, AWS EC2, AWS S3.

- __PaaS__ (_Plataform as a Service_): Services to run applications over infrastructure abstraction. For example, Run a web app, and delivered static files.
> Examples: Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, OpenShift etc.

- __FaaS__ (_Function as a Service_): Function as a Service, granular services to simplify recurring tasks. For example: send email, send webhook, rsync data base.
> Examples: AWS Data Sync, AWS Lambda.

## Main Deployment Models

The main Deployment Models are:

- __Private Cloud__: _"Bared Metal Cloud"_, Owner cloud, the resources is not shared with other corporates. 
> Should be created for example, with OpenStack, VMWare, XenServer. 

- __Public Cloud__: The Cloud shares resources Anyone can use. AWS, GCP, Oracle Cloud. You can be contract one the enterprise 
> AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, Alibaba Cloud.

- __Hybrid Cloud__: Cloud composed of parts __Private Cloud__ and __Public Cloud__.

- __Multicloud__: Cloud architecture is non-dependent on the specific Cloud model. Run as the same way in __Private Cloud__, __Public Cloud__.

- __Community__: Custom Cloud architecture is created by corporations foe to provide the clients, the flexibility of the more one __Cloud Public__ and __Private Cloud__ features.
