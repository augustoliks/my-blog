# Demystifying: $ git log

The `git log` command is a powerful tool in Git for viewing the commit history within a repository. It provides a comprehensive overview of commits, allowing you to track changes, understand commit details, and navigate through your project's development timeline.

## Basic Usage

To use `git log`, simply type the following in your terminal:

```bash
git log
```

This command will display a list of commits in reverse chronological order (from the latest to the earliest). Each commit is accompanied by information such as the commit hash, author details, date, and commit message.

## Limiting the Output

You can limit the log output using various options:

- Display the last N commits:

```bash
git log -n N
```

- Show a specific range of commits:

```bash
git log <commit-hash-start>..<commit-hash-end>
```

## Custom Formatting

You can customize the output format of `git log` using the `--pretty` option. For instance:

- Display a compact representation of commits:

```bash
git log --pretty=oneline
```

- Show a detailed log with the commit message and changes:

```bash
git log --pretty=full
```

- Customize the format using placeholders:

```bash
git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an
```
