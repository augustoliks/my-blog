## Main Cloud Models

The primary Cloud Models are:

- __IaaS__ (Infrastructure as a Service): Infrastructure components delivered as a service, such as Virtual Machines, Networks, Firewalls, etc.
  - Examples: AWS VPC, AWS EC2, AWS S3.

- __PaaS__ (Platform as a Service): Services to run applications over infrastructure abstraction. For example, running a web app and delivering static files.
  - Examples: Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, OpenShift, etc.

- __FaaS__ (Function as a Service): Granular services to simplify recurring tasks, such as sending emails, webhooks, or syncing databases.
  - Examples: AWS Data Sync, AWS Lambda.
