# Hello There!

It' is my space to share my firsthand experiences in the realm of DevOps.

These include but are not limited to DevOps methodologies like: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Python, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Kubernetes, ELK stack and OpenSearch.

Through this platform, I aim to share insights, experiences, and knowledge about my journey within these domains.
