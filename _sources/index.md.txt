# Hello There!

I created this platform to share my firsthand experiences in the realm of DevOps.

These include but are not limited to DevOps methodologies, Python programming, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), automation, Kubernetes, OpenSearch, and efficient log management.

Through this platform, I aim to share insights, experiences, and knowledge about my journey within these domains.
