# Git Clients Benchmarking: CLI vs. Graphical Interfaces

This blog post is aimed at helping you understand the pros and cons of the most popular Git repository clients.

The content was created with a focus on everyday use for fundamental tasks. 

I presented the solutions pros/cons and my particular conclusion and suggestions.

## 1. Command Line Interface (CLI)

It is the official method for interacting with your repository. You can perform all the functions that the Git system provides using the Git CLI. It also offers comprehensive documentation, and official resources typically use Git CLI in their examples.

<i class="fa-solid fa-face-smile"></i> Key Pros:
- __Full Functionality__: Git CLI offers all functionalities and capabilities that Git provides, ensuring nothing is compromised.
---
- __Scripting and Automation__: Easily integrate Git commands into scripts and automate repetitive tasks.

<i class="fa-solid fa-face-frown"></i> Key Cons:
- __Learning Curve__: For those unfamiliar with command-line interfaces, there may be a learning curve to grasp the commands and their usage effectively.
---
- __Less Visual Representation__: Git CLI provides data primarily through text output, which can be less intuitive for some users.
---
- __Productivity__: Repetitive and extensive use of fundamental operations can become unproductive.

## Conclusion (Author Opinion)

The Git CLI mastering is fundamental before to use the Graphical solutions. The GUI solutions are made to provides agility in the recurring operations. Only use the Git GUI solutions if you understand that what's happening behind the scenes. The GUI solutions helps to make the changes, but when a big problems occurs, probably you will needs to use the Git CLI to solve it.

The choice between Git CLI and graphical interfaces depends on your preference, familiarity with command-line tools, and the specific needs of your project. 

- If you works a __Software Developer__, my suggestion is mastering the use of the tool your IDE provides.

- If you work several stacks, like me as a __DevOps Engineer__, I suggest using VSCode Git integration. It provides a simple UX/UI for a quick way to check the commit differences in one place, and the free version of the extension [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)  provides a simple way to perform more advanced operations like _squash_ and _rebase_.

- For __Release Engineer__ enterprise workloads, the GitKraken sounds like the better chosen because your UI/UX brings pretty historical commits graphics. If you work an Atlassian stack, and Linux workstations are not used, the SourceTree can be a good idea because integrations with Atlassian Stack are available.
